# Flocking Space Hamsters

My first experiments with the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/). The plan was to implement a basic [boids/flocking algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) on some space hamsters - they will attempt to zoom about space together, whilst avoiding asteroid obstacles.

I have no idea how Blender works so the models aren't particularly pretty.
